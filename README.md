# Work Day Scheduler
This project uses html, css, and javascript to create a planner for the current day. It allows the user to input text into areas labeled with different time slots and can save the text so they can come back to the page and it would still be there. 
The code uses google fonts, bootstrap, jquery and dayjs as third party apis
